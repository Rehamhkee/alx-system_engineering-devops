 Issue Summary:
*Duration*: August 13, 2024, from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM GMT+1  
*Impact*: For two and a half hours, I was blocked by a frustrating bug in my code that caused a key variable to return undefined unexpectedly. This bug halted my progress on a critical feature update for my weather web application, resulting in significant delays.  
*Root Cause*: The root cause was a typo in a variable name, which led to the variable being undefined and causing a cascade of errors throughout the application.

#### Timeline:
- *4:00 PM* - Issue detected when my code, which relied on a specific variable, began consistently failing during testing.
- *4:10 PM* - Initial debugging efforts began by reviewing recent code changes, suspecting a problem with the new feature I was implementing.
- *4:30 PM* - Misleading path: I assumed the issue might be with the external weather API, leading to a detailed examination of API responses, which ultimately proved to be correct.
- *5:15 PM* - After exhausting other possibilities, I turned my attention back to the codebase, looking for any subtle mistakes.
- *5:45 PM* - Root cause identified: A typo in the variable declaration where forecastData was mistakenly written as forecastDatta. This typo caused the variable to return undefined.
- *6:00 PM* - Fix implemented by correcting the typo and adding additional checks to ensure variable names were consistent throughout the code.
- *6:30 PM* - Issue fully resolved, and I resumed work on the feature update.

#### Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a simple typo. I accidentally typed forecastDatta instead of forecastData in a crucial part of the code, which led to the variable being undefined whenever it was called. This error went unnoticed for some time because the typo was subtle, and it caused a chain reaction of errors that were difficult to trace back to a single source.

To resolve the issue, I corrected the typo and reviewed the entire codebase to ensure no similar mistakes were present. I also implemented additional safeguards, such as stricter type-checking and updated my linter configuration to catch similar issues in the future.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
This incident highlighted the importance of attention to detail and the need for robust tools to catch human errors, especially when working solo. To prevent similar issues in the future, I plan to take the following steps:

*Improvements:*
1. *Stricter Linting Rules*: Update my linter configuration to flag variables with names that are too similar, reducing the likelihood of typos going unnoticed.
2. *Code Reviews*: Although working solo, I will adopt a habit of conducting thorough self-reviews, particularly focusing on consistency in variable names and declarations.
3. *Automated Testing*: Expand my test suite to include checks for undefined variables or inconsistencies in the code.

*TODO List:*
- [ ] Implement new linting rules to detect and flag suspiciously similar variable names.
- [ ] Add a step in my development process for manually checking variable names for accuracy before finalizing code.
- [ ] Create unit tests that verify all critical variables are correctly defined and utilized.
- [ ] Study and apply defensive programming techniques to reduce the risk of similar issues in the future.

In conclusion, this issue was a frustrating reminder of the importance of precision in coding, especially when working independently. However, it has also provided valuable insights and improvements that will make my development process more resilient in the future.
